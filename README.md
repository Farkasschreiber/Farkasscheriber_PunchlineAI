**Punchlines AI** is an AI joke generation tool built on top of a large language model (LLM). It was fine-tuned on ~10k late night comedy monologue jokes. 

Using techniques like transfer learning and domain-specific fine-tuning, the model optimizes joke delivery by analyzing linguistic patterns, timing, and punchline structures.

The training process leveraged GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks to fine-tune the LLM on a curated dataset, balancing perplexity and humor relevance metrics. The system utilizes token embeddings and sequence-to-sequence modeling to create original, context-aware jokes that land every time (well, almost).
